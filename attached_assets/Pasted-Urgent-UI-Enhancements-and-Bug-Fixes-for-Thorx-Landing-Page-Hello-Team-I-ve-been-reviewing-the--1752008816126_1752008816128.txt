Urgent UI Enhancements and Bug Fixes for Thorx Landing Page
Hello Team,

I've been reviewing the recent updates to the Thorx landing page and have identified a few critical areas that need immediate attention to elevate the user experience and visual appeal. My goal is to ensure every aspect of the page aligns with Thorx's professional and sleek image.

1. Header Text Glow Issue Across Sections
Observation: I've noticed an unintended glow effect on the header text in each section of the landing page.
Request: Please identify and remove this glow effect. The header text should appear clean and sharp without any artificial luminescence.

2. Hero Section Text Redesign
Observation: The current text in the hero section appears unattractive and doesn't capture the sophisticated feel we're aiming for.
Request: Transform the hero section text to be ultra-attractive. This involves:
* Utilizing minimalistic colors that complement the overall Thorx theme.
* Adopting the exact font style used in the Thorx logo to ensure brand consistency and visual impact.
* The goal is a sleek, modern, and captivating presentation.

3. Cloud Visual Quality Improvement
Observation: The current cloud animations, while present, are unfortunately unattractive. They don't resemble realistic clouds, possibly due to low resolution, rendering issues, or other factors.
Request: Please address the visual quality of the clouds. They should look like high-fidelity, realistic clouds, maintaining the atmospheric and immersive experience we discussed. Investigate the cause of their current appearance (e.g., resolution, texture, rendering methods) and implement the necessary fixes to make them truly appealing.

4. Header Text Hover Box Issue
Observation: When I hover my mouse over the header text in any section, a distinct box outline appears around it. This is distracting and detracts from the clean aesthetic.
Request: Please remove this hover box effect. Header text should remain visually consistent whether hovered over or not.

Your expertise in resolving these issues will significantly enhance the overall polish and professionalism of the Thorx landing page. Please prioritize these fixes, and let me know if any further clarification or resources are needed.

Thank you for your dedication to perfecting Thorx!
