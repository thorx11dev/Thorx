Thorx Website Issues and Enhancement Requests
I have identified several issues and improvement opportunities in the recently created pages of the Thorx platform. Please address the following points carefully:

1. Navigation Behavior on Footer Links
Issue: When clicking footer links on the landing page, the destination pages load scrolled to the bottom instead of the top.

Request: Modify the navigation behavior so that when users click these footer links, the pages open starting at the top.

2. Blog Page Content and Functionality
Issue: Blog articles on the blog page are incomplete and unreadable.

Request: Write and add complete, well-structured blog articles. Implement functionality that allows users to easily read the full content of each blog post.

3. Input Box Design Improvement
Issue: Input fields, such as the “Send a Message” section on the contact page, look unattractive and outdated.

Request: Redesign these input boxes to be visually appealing and consistent with the overall theme and design of Thorx, enhancing the user experience.

4. Button Visibility and Interaction
Issue: Current button interactions are unappealing and cause visibility problems.

Request: Improve button styles and interactions to make them more prominent, visually engaging, and user-friendly.

5. Update Contact Information
Please update the contact details with the following information:

Emails:

Phone Number:

6. Remove Live Chat Feature
Request: Completely remove the live chat option from the website.

7. Add Physical Address
Request: Add the following address to the contact or relevant section:
