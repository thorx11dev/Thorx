## Enhanced Prompt for Replit Agent

Below is a refined and structured prompt you can send to the Replit Agent to guide the requested changes, ensure clarity, and facilitate thorough testing:

### Instructions for Landing Page Enhancement

**Objective:**  
Recreate the landing page while strictly preserving the hero section and the overall design. The hero section must remain unchanged in both content and styling. The rest of the landing page should maintain the existing design language but feature new sections, enhanced animations, and micro-interactions.

#### Requirements

1. **Preserve Hero Section**
   - Do not alter the hero section in any way (content, layout, or design).
   - Ensure the hero section remains visually and functionally identical to the original.

2. **Update Other Sections**
   - Replace or update all other sections of the landing page (excluding the hero section).
   - Add new, relevant content to these sections, ensuring it aligns with the platformâ€™s goals and user expectations.
   - Maintain the overall design consistency and coherence throughout the page.

3. **Enhance Animations and Micro-Interactions**
   - Introduce a variety of new animations and micro-interactions across the updated sections.
   - Ensure these enhancements improve user engagement and experience without detracting from usability or accessibility.
   - Animations and micro-interactions should be smooth, performant, and non-intrusive.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - After implementing the changes, thoroughly analyze the landing page to confirm that all content is visible and accessible to users.
   - Test every single component and section on the landing page for proper rendering, responsiveness, and interactive behavior.
   - Verify that there are no visual or functional issues across different devices and screen sizes.

5. **Accessibility and Usability**
   - Ensure all new content and interactions are accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
   - Confirm that color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes are properly implemented.

#### Deliverables

- A fully updated landing page with:
  - The original hero section unchanged.
  - New content and sections elsewhere on the page.
  - Enhanced animations and micro-interactions.
- Confirmation that all content is visible and accessible.
- Documentation of the testing process and results for each component and section.

**Please proceed with these instructions, and provide feedback or a summary of the changes and testing outcomes upon completion.**
