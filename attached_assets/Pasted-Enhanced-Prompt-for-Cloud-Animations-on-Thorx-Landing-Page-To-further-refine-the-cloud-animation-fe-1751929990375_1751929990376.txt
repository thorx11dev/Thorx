Enhanced Prompt for Cloud Animations on Thorx Landing Page
To further refine the cloud animation feature on the Thorx landing page, please address the following requirements:

Cloud Structure and Animation
Use Provided Cloud Structure:
Replicate the exact cloud structure and appearance as shown in the provided image for all cloud elements across the landing page.

Waving Animations:
Animate the clouds with natural, gentle waving motions to create a lifelike and dynamic effect. The animation should be smooth and continuous, enhancing the visual appeal without being distracting.

Placement and Visibility
Clouds in Every Section:
Ensure that the animated clouds appear consistently in every section of the landing page, not just the hero section. Their presence should create a cohesive and immersive experience throughout the entire page.

No Glass Effect Backgrounds:
Do not apply any glass effect or frosted glass backgrounds to the sections. Maintain the existing background style to preserve clarity and design consistency.

Implementation Guidelines
Consistency:
The clouds should maintain the same style, structure, and animation behavior in all sections for a unified look.

Non-Intrusive Design:
Position the clouds so they enhance the pageâ€™s atmosphere without obstructing important content or reducing readability.

Performance:
Use efficient animation techniques (such as CSS3, Canvas, or WebGL) to ensure smooth performance across devices.

Summary of Requests
Use the exact cloud design from the provided image.

Animate clouds with gentle waving effects.

Display clouds in every section of the landing page.

Do not use glass effect backgrounds for any section.

Ensure the design remains visually appealing, cohesive, and user-friendly.

Please proceed with these enhancements. Let me know if you require further clarification or additional references.
