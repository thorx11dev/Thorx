Prompt for Replit Agent:

Hello,

I need your assistance to optimize the structured layout of the hero section on the Thorx landing page exclusively for mobile screens. Please carefully follow these instructions:

Scope of Work:

Only modify the layout structure of the hero section on the landing page when viewed on mobile devices (small screen widths).

Do not alter any visual design elements such as colors, fonts, images, icons, buttons, or text content.

Do not change or affect any other sections of the landing page or any other pages within the Thorx platform.

The desktop layout and design must remain exactly as is.

Objective:

Rearrange the existing hero section components (e.g., headline, subheadline, call-to-action buttons, images, or any other elements present) to improve visibility, readability, and user experience on mobile screens.

Ensure that all hero section content is easily accessible without horizontal scrolling or overlapping.

Maintain proper spacing and alignment to avoid clutter and improve clarity.

The hero section must load and display correctly on all common mobile screen sizes.

Technical Details:

Implement the layout changes using responsive design best practices (CSS media queries, flexbox/grid adjustments, or any other appropriate method).

Avoid introducing new dependencies or frameworks.

Ensure that the rearrangement does not negatively impact page load speed or accessibility.

Test the hero section on multiple mobile viewport widths to verify consistent visibility and usability.

Deliverables:

Provide the updated code snippets or files with the rearranged layout for the hero section on mobile.

Include comments or documentation explaining the changes made and how they improve mobile visibility.

Confirm that no other parts of the landing page or other pages have been modified.

Please prioritize maintaining the integrity of the original design while enhancing the mobile user experience through thoughtful rearrangement of the hero section layout.

Thank you for your meticulous attention to detail.
