Improvement Request: Enhance Cloud Animations on Thorx Landing Page
I have noticed several issues with the current cloud animations on the Thorx landing page that need to be addressed to improve realism and user experience:

Lack of Realism:
The clouds currently do not look realistic. They lack natural 3D effects such as gentle waving or subtle rain animations that would make them feel alive and dynamic.

Missing 3D Effects:
The clouds should incorporate 3D visual effects to add depth and volume, enhancing the immersive feel. Effects like volumetric shading, soft shadows, or light scattering would greatly improve their appearance.

Visibility Issues During Scrolling:
The clouds tend to hide or disappear when scrolling through different sections of the landing page, which breaks the immersive experience and reduces visual continuity.

Requested Enhancements:
Implement realistic 3D cloud animations that include natural motions such as waving or drifting, and optional rain effects if suitable.

Use advanced animation techniques such as parallax scrolling combined with 3D effects to create depth and smooth movement.

Ensure the clouds remain visible and consistent across all landing page sections during scrolling and navigation.

Maintain performance efficiency by using optimized methods such as WebGL, Canvas, or SVG animations with hardware acceleration where possible.

Keep the clouds subtle and non-intrusive, complementing the overall minimalistic and modern design of Thorx.

Additional Notes:
Consider leveraging existing 3D modeling and animation tools (e.g., Blender, Three.js) or machine learning-based animation methods (such as DCGAN for cloud evolution) to achieve high-quality effects.

The goal is to create an engaging, visually appealing, and smooth cloud animation that enhances the landing pageâ€™s atmosphere without distracting users from the main content.

Please analyze the current implementation, identify the gaps, and apply these improvements thoughtfully to elevate the Thorx landing page experience.
