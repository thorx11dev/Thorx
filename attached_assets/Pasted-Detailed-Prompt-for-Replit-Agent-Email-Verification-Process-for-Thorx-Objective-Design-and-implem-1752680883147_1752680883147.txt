Detailed Prompt for Replit Agent: Email Verification Process for Thorx
Objective
Design and implement a complete email verification system for the Thorx revenue-sharing platform. This system must prompt new users to verify their email address after registration, enabling access to Thorx features upon successful verification.

Functional Requirements
Trigger: After completing registration, users must immediately receive a notification to verify their email address before they can access any Thorx platform features.

Verification Email:

Send an email to the address provided during registration.

The email must feature Thorx branding and content, presenting a visually appealing design aligned with Thorx’s identity.

The body should clearly explain the importance of email verification for unlocking full Thorx platform access.

Include call-to-action language that motivates users to complete the process.

Embed an advanced and secure email verification link (e.g., time-limited, single-use, using a signed token) that enables users to verify ownership of the email address.

Verification Endpoints:

Create an endpoint that the verification link lands on, which will mark the email as verified if the token is valid.

Handle all appropriate edge cases (expired, reused, or tampered tokens), and provide friendly, branded feedback to the user.

User Notification:

After registration, display an on-screen message stating:
“A verification email has been sent to your address. Please check your inbox and follow the instructions to verify your email and unlock Thorx features.”

Block access to platform features until verification is complete.

Technical Guidelines
Employ best practices for secure email verification, ensuring tokens cannot be guessed or forged.

Structure the code for easy future modifications (e.g., updating branding, email templates).

Ensure responsive behavior in both the verification email and the user-facing messages for mobile and desktop devices.

Use environment variables or secure storage for mail server credentials and sender identity.

Thorx Branding & Content Requirements
Emails must feature:

The Thorx logo and color palette.

A short welcome message introducing the Thorx platform’s benefits.

A clear button or link labeled "Verify Your Email and Unlock Thorx."

Professional design (consider HTML/CSS for formatting) that reflects the innovative and user-focused nature of Thorx.

Consider including a footer with Thorx contact/support information and links to platform policies.
