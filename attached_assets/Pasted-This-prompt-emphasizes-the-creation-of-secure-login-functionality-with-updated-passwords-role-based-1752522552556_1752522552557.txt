Prompt for Replit Agent:

Project Context:

We are building a secure, role-based team member infrastructure for the Thorx platform. Team members will log in with updated passwords, and upon login, they will have access to specific pages in the navigation bar according to their role. The pages must be fully functional, well-designed, and responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.

Requirements:

User Authentication:

Update login credentials for team members as follows:

Aon Imran: Password ThorxAonImran!9426

Zain Abbas: Password ThorxZainAbbas@1111

Zohaib Nadeem: Password ThorxZohaibNadeem#7777

Prof. Muhammad Jahangeer: Password ThorxMuhammadJahangeer$0000

Implement secure password handling (hashing, salting).

On login, verify credentials and load the appropriate user interface.

Role-Based Navigation & Page Access:

Define the following pages with specific functionalities and access rights:

Pages:

Dashboard: Common landing page after login for all team members.

User Care: Divided into two sections:

Database: Display real-time user account information (name, email, password masked, phone).

Report: Allow team members to ban/unban user accounts with mandatory reason input. Banned users and reasons must be stored and reflected on the Banned page.

Banned: Visible only to banned users when they attempt to log in. Displays the ban reason and restricts access to other pages.

Inbox: Stores all contact messages sent by users via the contact page. Messages should be displayed in an inbox format similar to Gmail for easy support management.

Linkage: A real-time text communication interface between team members, similar to WhatsApp chat functionality.

Team Hub: Accessible only by Aon Imran (CEO/Founder). Enables changing passwords for other team members securely.

Digital Market: Accessible only by Aon Imran and Zohaib Nadeem. Contains navigation links to Thorx social media accounts and displays the Social Media MVP of the month for marketing purposes.

Work: (Assumed existing or to be created) Included in navigation for all team members.

Settings: Common settings page for all team members.

Navigation bar pages per user:

Functional Details:
