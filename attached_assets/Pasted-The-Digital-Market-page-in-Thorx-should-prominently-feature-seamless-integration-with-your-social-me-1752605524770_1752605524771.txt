Key Features and Implementation Recommendations for the Digital Market Page
Navigation to All Thorx Social Media Accounts

Provide clearly branded, clickable icons or buttons linking to Thorx’s official social media profiles (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok).

Use customized icon styles that harmonize with Thorx’s palette: e.g., Nebula Blue (#5A67D8) for primary buttons, Galactic Purple (#805AD5) on hover states, as per your design elements .

Position these links prominently, e.g., top or center of the page for easy access on both mobile and desktop.

Ensure links open in new tabs to keep user retention on the platform.

Dynamic Social Media MVP Section

Display the “Social Media MVP of the Month” dynamically, featuring top-performing social media content or team member achievements related to digital marketing.

Use a card layout with the Pure White background (#FFFFFF) elevated by subtle shadows for content separation, and Deep Space Charcoal (#1A202C) text for clarity .

Include images, short highlights, and calls to action such as “View More” or “Celebrate” linking to further details.

Update this content monthly, potentially via a simple CMS or admin input by authorized team members.
