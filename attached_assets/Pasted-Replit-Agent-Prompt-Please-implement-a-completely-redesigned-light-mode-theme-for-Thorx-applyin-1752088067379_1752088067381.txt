* Do not use any previous or old light mode theme colors anywhere.

* Ensure excellent visibility and accessibility throughout the light mode UI, with sufficient contrast for all text, icons, buttons, charts, tooltips, and interactive elements, meeting or exceeding WCAG AA standards.

* Update all charts and tooltip colors on these pages to maintain clarity and visibility against the new light backgrounds, using the accent colors appropriately.

* The dark/light mode toggle switch must be fully functional and visually consistent, correctly activating this new light mode theme when toggled.

* Use the exact same Thorx logo as in dark mode, but adapt it for better visibility and appearance in light mode within the navigation bar.

* The navigation bar must be redesigned for better aesthetics and visibility in light mode, including background, text, icons, and hover states.

* The drop-down menu in the navigation bar must fully comply with the new light mode styling and color scheme.

* Apply the new light mode theme consistently and comprehensively across the entire UI of the five specified pages only. Do not alter any other pages or components outside this scope.

* Use modern, minimalistic, and cosmic-inspired styling consistent with the color palette and professional UI principles.

* Include subtle shadows, rounded corners, and smooth transitions for interactive elements to enhance depth and usability without compromising the light modeâ€™s airy feel.

* Ensure all form inputs, buttons, toggles, tables, badges, and status indicators on these pages reflect the new color scheme and maintain clear visual hierarchy.
